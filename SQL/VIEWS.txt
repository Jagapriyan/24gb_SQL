Often there are specific combinations of tables and conditions that we find yourself using quite often for a project.

Instead of having to perform the same query over and over again as a starting point, you can create VIEW to quickly see this query with a simple call.

Consider a DB which has two tables.

We often select columns from two tables and then work on it.

Example

T1

C1 C2

T2

C3 C4


Instead of using 

SELECT C1,C2,C3,C4
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2
ON t1.c1 = t2.c3

We can use

SELECT * FROM view

So

A view is a database object that is of a stored query
A view can be accessed as a virtual table in PostgreSQL.
Notice that a view does not store data physically, it simply stores the query.

We can also update and alter existing views.


General Syntax

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
(QUERY)

Examples 
CREATE VIEW customer_info AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, address FROM customer
INNER JOIN address
ON customer.address_id = address.address_id

SELECT * FROM customer_info;


We can replace the view using following method

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_info AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, address,district FROM customer
INNER JOIN address
ON customer.address_id = address.address_id

ALTER VIEW

ALTER VIEW customer_info RENAME to c_info


Delete the view

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_info;

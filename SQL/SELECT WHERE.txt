SELECT and WHERE are the most fundamental SQL statements.
WHERE statement allows us to specify conditions for the rows to be returned. 
WHERE clause appears immediateley after FROM clause of SELECT statement
conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement
There are standard operators to construct the conditions. 

Basic WHERE Syntax

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
WHERE conditions;


Comparison operators

They check and compare the value of column with a value.
Operators
= Equal
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
<> or != not equal to

Logical Operators

Logical operators allow us to combine multiple comparison operators


AND
OR 
NOT

Note: to denote string, use single quote

Examples

Display the details of customer whose name is jared

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Jared';


Display the details of DVDs that has over $4 rental and over $19.99 replacement cost.

SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND
replacement_cost >= 19.99;

Return the count of Movies with above condition and rating is Return

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND
replacement_cost >= 19.99 AND rating = 'R';

Other Logical operators examples

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE
rating = 'R' or rating = 'PG-13'



SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE
rating <> 'R';

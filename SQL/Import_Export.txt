Not every outside data file will work, variations in formatting, macros, data types etc., may prevent the import command from reading the file, at which point, the file must be edited to be compatible with SQL.

refer online documentation. 

100% correct file path to the outside file should be provided. otherwise the import command will fail.

The most common mistake if failing to provide the correct file path, confirm the file's location under its properties. 


Import command does not create table. 
It assumes a table is already created.
Current there is no automated way in pgAdmin to create a table directly from a .csv file. 

CREATE A TABLE
 
CREATE TABLE cdr(
A_NUMBER INTEGER,
	B_NUMBER INTEGER,
	VALID_FROM INTEGER,
	IN_ANSWERED_UNITS INTEGER,
	IN_CARRIER_NAME VARCHAR(50),
	OUT_CARRIER_NAME VARCHAR(50)
)


Once table is created, right click table import/export
Click import -> enter the details and click ok

Example
Length

SELECT length(first_name) AS length_first_name FROM customer;


Concatenation

SELECT first_name || ' ' ||last_name AS name
FROM customer;


Upper case

SELECT upper(first_name) || ' ' ||upper(last_name) AS name
FROM customer;


Create email address

Here we use LEFT function which returns the truncated value. In this case, it returns 1 character from first_name column

SELECT LOWER(LEFT(first_name,1)) || LOWER(last_name) || '@gmail.com' AS email
FROM customer

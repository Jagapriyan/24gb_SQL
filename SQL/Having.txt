HAVING clause allows us to filter after an aggregation has already taken place
Filtering using WHERE caluse cannot be done on aggregate columns. Consider following example

SELECT company, SUM(SALES)
FROM companies
WHERE company != 'Google'
GROUP BY company; 

Here we cannot use filter on SUM(SALES).
We need to use HAVING, as it allows us to use the aggregate result as filter along with a GROUP BY.

SELECT company, SUM(SALES)
FROM companies
WHERE company != 'Google'
GROUP BY company
HAVING SUM(SALES) > 1000; 


EXAMPLES

Return the list of customers with over $100 payment

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;

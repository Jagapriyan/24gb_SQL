The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
It basically serves to directly concatenate two results together, essentially "pasting" them together. 



SYNTAX

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

Example Scenario

There are two tables for Q1 sales and Q2 sales. 

We can use UNION to view half yearly results. 

We can also use ORDER BY, SORT BY etc.,


Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC 
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC 
LIMIT 1);

TIMESTAMP 

These will be more useful when creating our own tables and databases, rather than when querying a database

Datatypes

TIME - Contains only time information
DATE - Contains only date information
TIMESTAMP - Contains, date and time information
TIMESTAMPTZ - Contains date, time and timezone information

Careful considerations should be made when designing a tbale and databases and choosing a time data type. 
Depending on the situation you may or may not need the full level of TIMESTAMPTZ

Note: We can always remove historical information but we can't add any. TIMESTAMPTZ Can be TIMESTAMP but TIMESTAMP cannot be changed as TIMESTAMPTZ.


Functions and operators related to specific data types:

TIMEZONE

Examples

SHOW ALL

SHOW TIMEZONE


NOW

Examples

SELECT NOW()


TIMEOFDAY

SELECT TIMEOFDAY()   - in string format easy to read

CURRENT_TIME

SELECT CURRENT_TIME

CURRENT_DATE

SELECT CURRENT_DATE

Extracting information from a time based data type using 
EXTRACT()
AGE()
TO_CHAR()


EXTRACT() - allows you to "extract" or obtain a sub-component of a date value
	Year     - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_col)
	Month
	Day
	Week
	Quarter
	
Examples

SELECT EXTRACT (YEAR FROM payment_date) AS payment_year
FROM payment;

SELECT EXTRACT (MONTH FROM payment_date) AS payment_month
FROM payment;

SELECT EXTRACT (QUARTER FROM payment_date) AS payment_quarter
FROM payment;
	

AGE() - Calculates and returns the current age given a timestamp. 

AGE(date_col)

Examples

SELECT AGE(payment_date)
FROM payment;



TO_CHAR() - General function to convert data types to text. Generally useful for timestamp formatting.

TO_CHAR(date_col,'mm-dd-yyyy') 

Examples

SELECT TO_CHAR (payment_date, 'mm-dd-yy')
FROM payment

SELECT TO_CHAR (payment_date, 'MONTH-YYYY')
FROM payment

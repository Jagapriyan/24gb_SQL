Working With Strings

Calculating length of a column

SELECT
LEN(description) AS description_length
FROM
grid;

Retrieve first 25 characters from a column

SELECT 
  LEFT(description, 25) AS first_25_left 
FROM 
  grid;
  
Retrieve last 25 characters from a column

SELECT 
  LEFT(description, 25) AS last_25_right
FROM 
  grid;
  

Use of CHARINDEX

CHARINDEX returns the index (starting location of the word). in below query, it will return the index of Weather in description column. 

SELECT
description,
CHARINDEX('Weather', description) AS start_of_string
FROM
grid
WHERE description LIKE '%Weather%';

To Find the starting point of string (index) and lenght of that

SELECT
description,
CHARINDEX('Weather', description) AS start_of_string,
LEN ('Weather') AS length_of_string
FROM
grid
WHERE
description LIKE '%Weather%';

Use of Substring - it returns string from a string while the start and end index is shared

SUBSTRING('columnname',start,end)


SELECTING TOP 10 rows to return the string after Weather. Here, the carindex is 8 and lenght of weather is 7.

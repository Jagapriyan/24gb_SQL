We can use the DELETE clause to remove rows from table

Example

DELETE FROM table
WHERE row_id = 1

We can delete rows based on their presence in other tables

Example

DELETE FROM tableA
USING tableB
WHERE tableA.id=TableB.id


DELETE all rows from a table 

Example
DELETE FROM table

SIMILAR to UPDATE command, we can also add in a RETURNING call to return rows that were removed.



Example from existing DB

DELETE FROM job
WHERE job_id = 3;


Example with Returning rows
This will return the deleted row

DELETE FROM job
WHERE job_id = 4
RETURNING job_id,job_name;



TRUNCATE

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name


TRUNCATE does not require a WHERE clause as it deletes all data from all columns at once.

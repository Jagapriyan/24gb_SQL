LIMIT commond allows us to limit the number of rows returned for a query. 
Useful for not wanting to return every single row in a table. 
It is used to just get an idea of the table layout
Very useful in combination with ORDER BY
LIMIT goes at the very end of a query request and is the last command to be executed. 

Example

choose the recent 5 transactions which are not 0 value.

SELECT * FROM payment
WHERE amount != 0
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
limit 5;

Aggregate Functions

The main idea of aggregate function is to take multiple input and return a single output.
Commonly used Aggregate Functions are 

AVG() - returns floating point value many decimal places (e.g 2.345678). We can use ROUND() to specify precision after the decimal. 
COUNT() - just retuns the number of rows. which means by convention we just use COUNT(*)
MIN()
MAX()
SUM()

aggregate Functions calls happen only in the SELECT clause or the HAVING clause

Some examples

Return the maximum and minimum replacement cost for a film

SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;

SELECT MAX(replacement_cost) FROM film;

COMBINING BOTH

SELECT MAX(replacement_cost), MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;


Note: We cannot combine an aggregated column with a normal column. This will return an error, as the aggregated column returns single value. 


What is the average cost of replacing films

SELECT ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost),2) FROM film;

what is the total cost of replacing all films

SELECT SUM(replacement_cost) FROM film;

What is the total number of movies in the store

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film;

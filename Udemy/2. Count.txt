COUNT function returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query
We can apply COUNT on a specific column or just pass COUNT	(*). Both will return same result. But it is better to use column name. 
Because of this, COUNT is simply the number of rows in a table. 
COUNT is much more useful when combined with other commands such as DISTINCT 

SELECT COUNT(*) AND SELECT COUNT(COLUMN)

Both will return same result


SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film;

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT

Syntax

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Column_name) Table_name;


The COUNT function is used over the DISTINCT function here. SQL will throw and error if we do not use paranthesis. 

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT first_name) FROM actor;

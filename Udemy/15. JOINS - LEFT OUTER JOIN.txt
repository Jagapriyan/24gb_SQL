What about when you want to compare all the values in one table with another, to see which rows match? That's when you can use a LEFT JOIN.

A LEFT JOIN will return ALL rows in the first table, and any matching rows in the right table. If there aren't any matches in the right table for a particular row, then a NULL is returned. This quickly lets you assess the gaps in your data, and how many you have.



A LEFT OUTER JOIN results in the set of records that re in the left table, if there is no match with the right table, the results are null.
LEFT OUTER JOIN is not symmetrical. The order of Table name in query matters here.
LEFT OUTER JOIN, grabs everything that matches in both column, rows that are exclusive to tableA (left table) and ignores the rows that are exclusive to tableb(right table)


SYNTAX
SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match

LEFT OUTER JOIN with WHERE CLAUSE - Get rows unique to left table
What if we only wanted entries unique to TableA? Those rows found in TableA and not found in Table B.

SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = tableb.col_match
WHERE TableB.id is NULL

Consider two tables

film and inventory

SELECT film.film_id,title,inventory_id,store_id
FROM film
LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory ON
inventory.film_id = film.film_id

Example Scenario

Find the list of movies that are not available in inventory

Solution:
We have two tables, film - contains all details about film
inventory - contains info whether a film is available or not

The left outer join here extracts all columns from tableA (film) and filters them with column on TableB(inventory) 

SELECT film.title, inventory.film_id, inventory.store_id, inventory.inventory_id
FROM film
LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory ON
film.film_id = inventory.film_id
WHERE inventory.film_id IS null;

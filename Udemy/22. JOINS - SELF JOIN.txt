A self-join is a query in which a table is joined to itself - it can be viewed as a join of two copies of the same table. 
Self-joins are useful for comparing values in a column of rows within the same table. 
There is no special keyword for a self-join, its simply standard JOIN syntax with the same table in both parts. 
However, when using self join it is necessary to use an alias for the table, otherwise the table names would be ambigous. 

SYNTAX

SELECT tableA.col, tableB.col
FROM table AS tableA 
JOIN table AS tableB ON
tableA.col = tableB.other_col


Example Scenario

Retrieve film title columns matching with length. 
The columns should be name of film and name of matching film and length. 
Note that same film should not be displayed. 

SELECT f1.title, f2.title, f1.length
FROM film AS f1
INNER JOIN film AS f2 ON
f1.length = f2.length 
AND f1.film_id != f2.film_id



Query explanation

f1 considered as TableA
f2 considered as TableB
INNER JOIN is used. 
we are matching length of films. 
Note: the last f1.film_id != f2.film_id is to avoid duplication of film name in two columns.

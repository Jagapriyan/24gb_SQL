CAST Operator

The CAST operator lest's you convert from one data type into another.

Note that not every instance of data type can be CAST to another data type, it must be reasonable to convert the data, for example '5' to an integer will work, 'five' to an integer will not. 

Syntax for CAST function

EX:
SELECT CAST('5' AS INTEGER) AS new_int;

This will throw an error

SELECT CAST('five' AS INTEGER) AS new_int;


ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type integer: "five"
LINE 1: SELECT CAST('five' AS INTEGER) AS new_int;
                    ^

Syntax for CAST Opertor (Only in PG)

SELECT '5'::INTEGER


Note that we can use this in a SELECT query with a column name instead of a single instance.

SELECT CAST(date AS TIMESTAMP)
FROM table

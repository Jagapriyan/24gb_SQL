RIGHT JOIN is the same as LEFT JOIN, except tables are switched. 
This would be same as switching the table order in a LEFT OUTER JOIN. 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN just grabs all the rows from TableA and leaves out rows exclusive to TableB.


SELECT * FROM TableA
RIGHT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match


Note: It depends on user to use single type of JOIN (LEFT / RIGHT) and interchange the tables to obtain required result.
For example, a result obtained by LEFT OUTER JOIN can be obtained by RIGHT OUTER JOIN by altering the table order

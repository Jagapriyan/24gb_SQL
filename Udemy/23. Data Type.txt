When creating databases and tables, you should carefully consider which data types should be used for the data to be stored. 

Example

Imagine we need to store phone number
Refer the documentation. 
smallint, integer, bigint etc., are options we have. 

Since we dont perform arithmetics with phonenumbers, we can use VARCHAR. It makes sense to choose this datatype since we are not doing any arithmetic.

Some practical issues in storing phone numbers as numeric datatypes

No arithmetic performed
Leading zeros could cause issues, (7 and 07 treated numerically but are not same phone number)

Primary and Foreign Keys

Primary key is a a column or a group of columns used to identify a row uniquely in a table.

Some examples are student id, customer id etc., which are unique and non-null. 

Primary keys are also important since they allow us to easily discern what columns should be used for joining tables together. 

Example

SELECT * FROM customer

Customer_id column is primary key [indicated as (PK)]

Foreign Key

A foreign key is field or group of fields in a table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. 
A foreign key is defined in a table that references to the primary key of the other table. 
A table that contains the foriegn key is called referencing table or child table. 
The table to which the foreign key references is called referenced table or parent table.
A table can have multiple foreign keys depending on its relationships with other tables. 

Ex:
In payment table, payment id is PK and customer id is FK. 


Note that primary key and foreign key typically make good column choices for joining together two or more tables. 
When creating tables and defining columns, we can use constraints to define columns as being a primary key or attaching a foreign key relationship to another table. 

How to check
Go to TABLE -> Constraints -> we can see the keys
Right click on them and in properties -> columns we can view the details
Also after selecting the key, in dependency we can view the connected tables

COALESCE

The COALESCE function accepts an unlimited number of arguments. It returns the first argument that is not null. If all arguments are null, the COALESCE function will return null.

COALESCE(arg_1,arg_2,...,arg_n)


Example

SELECT COALESCE(1,2)

Output
1


SELECCT COALESCE(NULL,2,3)

Output
2

Use of COALESCE function: It is useful when querying a table that contains null values and we need to substitute it with another value.


Consider a Table of products


Item Price Discount
A     100   20
B     300   null
C     200   10

Here Item B does not have a discount. 


Calculate final amount


SELECT, item,(price-discount) AS final 
FROM table

SQL cannot substract NULL FROM INTEGER. So it will return Final price of item B as NULL.

SELECT item,(price - COALESCE(discount,0))
AS final FROM table

Here SQL will see if there's non null value in discount it will return
If there is NULL in discount, it will return 0.

When we have a table with NULL values and we need to do mathematical operations, we can use this.

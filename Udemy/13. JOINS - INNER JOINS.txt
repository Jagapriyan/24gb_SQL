JOINS allows to combine multiple tables
The main reason for using JOINS is the availability of information in certain tables only.


INNER JOIN

Simplest of JOINS
The result will contain the set of records that match in both tables. It will ignore the records that does not match. 
INNER JOIN is symmetrical. Which means we can use the tables in any order for JOIN operation. The result will not be affected. 
IF we mention just JOIN, PostgreSQL will treat 
When selecting columns, for unique columns, we need not mention table name but for columns that are present in both tables, mention the table name in SELECT statement. 

Consider an example of a webinar. 
There will be people who register and attend / does not attend. Peple who attend and does not register. 
We will have two tables, registration table and attendance table. When we need only the records of people who register and attended, we need to use inner joins. 



SYNTAX

SELECT * FROM Table_A
INNER JOIN Table_B
ON Table_A.col_match = Table_B.col_match

 
Query for above scenario

SELECT * FROM registrations
INNER JOIN logins
ON registrations.name = logins.name

SELECT logins.name FROM registrations
INNER JOIN logins
ON registrations.name = logins.name

Examples from DVD Rental DB

the customer_id column is in payment and customer tables. 

EX1: JOIN both tables based on common column name. 
SELECT * FROM payment
INNER JOIN customer
ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id;

ex2: retrieve the list of customers who made purchases. (ignore customers who did not purchase)

SELECT payment_id, payment.customer_id, first_name FROM payment
INNER JOIN customer
ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id;


Multiple JOINS on single query 

SYNTAX

Note here we have used INNER JOIN, any JOIN can be used and for second JOIN, we used tables Table_B and Table_C. We can also use Table_A and Table_C based on matching columns. 


SELECT Table_A.columnname, Table_B.columnname, Table_C FROM Table_A
INNER JOIN Table_B
ON Table_A.col_match = Table_B.col_match
INNER JOIN Table_C
ON Table_B.col_match = Table_C.col_match

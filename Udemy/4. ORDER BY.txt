ORDER BY can be used to sort rows based on ascending or descending order
ORDER BY will be placed towards the end of a query, since we want to do any selection and filtering before finally sorting. 
ASC - Ascending order (default)
DESC - descending order

We can use ORDER BY for multiple columns. This makes sense when one column has duplicate entries. Use the duplicate column first when using ORDER BY. 


SYNTAX

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
ORDER BY column1 ASC / DESC;


Examples

Fetch all columns in customer column, sort by first name. 

SELECT * FROM customer
ORDER BY first_name;

Fetch store_id, first_name, last_name columns in customer column, sort by store_id and first name. 

SELECT store_id, first_name, last_name FROM customer
ORDER BY store_id, first_name;

Mixing the ORDER BY

SELECT store_id, first_name, last_name FROM customer
ORDER BY store_id DESC, first_name ASC;

We can also user ORDER BY without displaying them too. Typically it is not a good practice as the result will not show on what basis the columns are sorted. 

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer
ORDER BY store_id DESC, first_name ASC;

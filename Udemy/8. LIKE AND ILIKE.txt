Like operator is used for pattern matching against string data with the use of wildcard characters.
Percent (%) - Matches any sequence of characters 
Underscore (_) - Matches single character - for example get all Mission impossible films i.e Mission Impossible_. 
We can use multiple underscores


Some questions answered are,
>> find all emails ending in @gmail.com
>> All names begin with an A   - WHERE name LIKE 'A%'
>> All names end with a - WHERE name LIKE '%a'

Note: the % can be 1 character or more than one or nothing too. 

LIKE is case sensitive
ILIKE is case insensitive

We can also combine pattern matching operators to create more complex pattern matching

WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';

Count of them

SELECT COUNT (*)FROM customer

Combination of LIKE Statement

Return all rows for customer name starting with J and last_name starting with S



SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%' AND last_name LIKE 'S%'

return anyone who as 'er' in first_name

SELECT first_name FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE '%er%' 


Using NOT operator

SELECT first_name FROM customer
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%er%' 



Other examples

SELECT first_name FROM customer
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%er%' 
ORDER BY last_name;



SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%' AND last_name NOT LIKE 'B%' 
ORDER BY last_name;

OUTER JOINS allows us to specify how to deal with values only present in one of the tables being joined.
These are complex JOINS. 


In previous INNER JOIN, when we match columns from two tables, only the rows that are matched were retrieved.
In case of FULL OUTER JOIN, it just grabs all the rows from the columns that are matched. 
FULL OUTER JOIN is symmetrical. Changing the table order will not change the result. 
FULL OUTER JOIN will have NULL values where we only have row present in one particular table. 

SYNTAX
SELECT * FROM Table_A
FULLER OUTER JOIN Table_B
ON Table_A.column_match = Table_B.column_match;

FULL OUTER JOIN WITH WHERE CLAUSE (EXACT OPPOSITE TO INNER JOIN) - it will return rows that are unique to each table. Common rows will be discarded.

SYNTAX

SELECT * FROM Table_A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B
ON Table_A.column_match = Table_B.column_match
WHERE Table_A.id IS NULL OR Table_B.id IS NULL; 

As mentioned above, this syntax will return rows that are unique either to Table_A or Table_B.


Examples

We don't want to have any customer information that does not have payment and any payment information that is not connected to a customer. 

SELECT * FROM customer
FULL OUTER JOIN payment
ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
WHERE customer.customer_id IS null OR 
payment.customer_id IS null;

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
We can combine queries from same table or from different tables. 
It basically serves to directly concatenate two results together, essentially "pasting" them together. 
The tables should have same structure. The tables should have same number of columns, the columns should be listed in the same order and have similar datatypes. 
UNION excludes duplicate rows. While UNION ALL returns duplicate rows as well. 


SYNTAX

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

Example Scenario

There are two tables for Q1 sales and Q2 sales. 

We can use UNION to view half yearly results. 

We can also use ORDER BY, SORT BY etc.,


Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC 
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC 
LIMIT 1);

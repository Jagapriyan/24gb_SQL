CREATE AND UPDATE, DELETE AND INSERT are called as CRUD operations. 

CRUD

CREATE 
	- Database, Table, Views
	- Users, permissions and security groups
	
READ

	- Example: SELECT statements
	
UPDATE

	- Amend existing database records
	
DELETE 

General Syntax

CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name TYPE column_constraint,
column_name TYPE column_constraint,
table_constraint table_constraint
) INHERITS existing_table_name;


COMMON Simple Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name TYPE column_constraint,
column_name TYPE column_constraint,
);


Note

In PostgreSQL, a sequence is a special kind of database object that generates a sequence of integers.
A sequence is often used as the primary key column in a table.

SERIAL

SERIAL will create a sequence object and set the next value generated by the sequence as the default value for the column.
This is perfect for a primary key, because it logs unique integer entries for you automatically upon insertion. 
If a row is later removed, the column with the SERIAL data type will not adjust, marking the fact that a row was removed from the sequence. for example
	1,2,3,5,6,7 - It will show that 4 was removed at some point. 
Refer datatypes in PostgreSQL.

Example

CREATE TABLE players(
player_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
age smallint NOT NULL 
);



Working example
First create a new database

Rigth click database -> create -> type name and save
Then click querytool on new DB

CREATE TABLE account(
user_id SERIAL PRIMARY_KEY,
username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(250) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
last_login TIMESTAMP
);


CREATE TABLE job(
job_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
job_name VARCHAR(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE account_job(
user_id INTEGER REFERENCES account(user_id),
job_id INTEGER REFERENCES job(job_id),
hire_date TIMESTAMP
);

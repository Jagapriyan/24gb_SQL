SELECT is the most commom statement used, and it allows us to retreive information from a table


Syntax:

SELECT column_name FROM table_name


SQL Keywords are capitalized (this is not mandatory but it is good for recognizing the keywords). 
We can also use semicolon at the end or we can leave it as well. 

Tables have columns and rows like spreadsheets.

The query will be read in reverse order, first it will see the table and then towards the columns. 

Note: Asterisk (*) with SELECT statement will return all the columns from the table. In general this is not a good practice as it will slow down the conneciton between DB and application.


Return all columns

SELECT * FROM actor;

SELECT * FROM actor limit 10;

Select required column (s)

SELECT first_name FROM actor;

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

DISTINCT

DISTINCT keyword can be used to return only the distinct values in a column. This keyword operates on a column.

Syntax

SELECT DISTINCT column FROM table_name

or

SELECT DISTINCT(column) FROM table_name

Example

SELECT DISTINCT(release_year) FROM film;

SELECT DISTINCT(rental_rate) FROM film;

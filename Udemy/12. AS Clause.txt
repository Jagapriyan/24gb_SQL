AS clause allows us to create an alias for a column or result

Syntax

SELECT column AS new_name
FROM table


Example

SELECT amount AS rental_price
FROM payment;


SELECT SUM(amount) AS net_revenue
FROM payment;


Note: 
The AS operator gets exectued at the very end of the query, meaning that we cannot use ALIAS inside a WHERE operator or any other filtering operators.

EX:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;

in above query, HAVING clause uses only the SUM(amount) instead of total_payment which is an alias for SUM(amount).
SQL will throw an error if we use alias in filters. ALIAS is applied only at the end of the query.
